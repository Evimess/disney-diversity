**Reflection**

The process of creating a digital humanities project has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. Our group has been able to explore the both the humanities and computing aspects of our project extensively. We have been able to explore the humanities aspect of our project by researching the history of Disney and Pixar and how they have developed inclusivity in their films over the years. We have also been able to explore the computing aspect of our project by using Python to analyze and visualize data.
